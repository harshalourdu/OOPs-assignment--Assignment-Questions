    "The close() function is used to close an open file. This function is important for the following reasons:\n",

    "Releasing Resources: Closing a file frees up system resources associated with the file. Not closing a file could lead to memory leaks or depletion of file handles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Saving Changes: For files opened in write or append mode, calling close() ensures that any changes or data written to the file are saved properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Preventing Data Corruption: When a file is closed, any buffered data is written to disk. If you do not close the file, some data might remain in memory and not be written to the file, potentially leading to data loss or corruption."
